          <div id="text"><p class="text"> To build a commercial smart meter that would be used within a moving Medical site which would opperate in areas of large struggle. Each team is allocated six EEE students and has the goal of building powersupply, housing, interface cricuitry and software (that consists of control system, interface and additional features) </p></div>

      <div id="twoContainer">
        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">Team Structure:</h3></div>
          <div id="text"><p class="text"> I nominated myself as the Team Lead. Other roles: Treasurer (for 25Â£ spending limit) and Organiser (for meetings date/time, minutes etc.) <br> As the Lead I divided the team into Power supply, Housing, Interface and Programming Subteams. I took the role as Head of Programming where I developed the control system, LCD interface and additional (wireless) interfaces. Additionally I helped with Housing team with the initial design and the interface circuitry with building simulation models on Multisim</p></div>

        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">My Involvement:</h3></div>
          <div id="text"><p class="text"> [Programming, C] I implemented a basic multi-path control system. The system develops an out-come (not always 'output') depending on the current state of the Medical centre (described by inputs). Its relatively simple in design however serveral minimisation techniques were used to ensure that the concept acts more efficiently. This is important in Medical situations where everything is time-pressured. I also implemented an LCD interface which displays key results with an additional graph-features to create a better looking UI. <br>[Programming, C++] As an additional feature I built a wireless access point (WAP) using a NodeMCU (Arduino with WIFI module) which hosted a website (using local WIFI) which displayed the same values as the LCD interface with additional calculations. The site is smartphone-friendly and incorporates controlability using HTTP POST and GET input methods to control the LCD interface as well as manually changing the current state of the Medical center. <br>[Housing] I developed the 
intial housing model. I implemented "intsert" walls that would prevent water from entering the body. As the 3D printers provided were relatively small I designed the levels of the body to be stacked and screwed from the inside to create a strong structure. Features within the hosuing consist of ledges for rest the LCD screen in and particular positioning of screws for PCB and micrcontroller mounting.
[Interface Circuitry] I built and modeled a PWM output signal which was used to control an boost the output of signals from 3.3V (microcontroller output) to 5V (required output).
