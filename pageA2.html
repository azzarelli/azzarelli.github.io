          <div id="text"><p class="text"><span style="font-weight:900"> [This is a University project which is equivalent to one module]</span>
<br>&nbsp <span style="font-weight:900">Aim:</span> to build a commercial smart meter that would be used within a moving Medical site which would opperate in areas of large struggle.
<br> <span style="font-weight:900">Method:</span> Each team is allocated six EEE students and has the goal of building a powersupply, housing, interface cricuitry and software that makes up the smart meter.
You are given 25£ budget with 7-week deadline and are expected to log individual progress in logbooks to show your involvement within the project. Each subteam has a set of
standards that the team must abide by to be successfully marked.

      <div id="twoContainer">
        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">Team Structure:</h3></div>
          <div id="text"><p class="text"> I nominated myself as the Team Lead. Other roles: Treasurer (for 25£ spending limit) and Organiser (for meetings date/time, minutes etc.) <br> As the Lead I divided the team into Power supply, Housing, Interface and Programming Subteams. I took the role as Head of Programming where I developed the control system, LCD interface and additional (wireless) interfaces. Additionally I helped with Housing team with the initial design and the interface circuitry with building simulation models on Multisim</p></div>
      </div>

      <div id="threeContainer">
        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">My Involvement:</h3></div>
          <div id="text"><p class="text"> <span style="font-weight:bold">[Programming, C]</span><br>&nbsp I implemented a basic multi-path control system. The system develops an out-come (not always 'output') depending on the current state of the Medical centre (described by inputs). Its relatively simple in design however serveral minimisation techniques were used to ensure that the concept acts more efficiently. This is important in Medical situations where everything is time-pressured. I also implemented an LCD interface which displays key results with an additional graph-features to create a better looking UI. 
            <br><span style="font-weight:900">[Programming, C++]</span><br>&nbsp As an additional feature I built a wireless access point (WAP) using a NodeMCU (Arduino with WIFI module) which hosted a website (using local WIFI) which displayed the same values as the LCD interface with additional calculations. The site is smartphone-friendly and incorporates controlability using HTTP POST and GET input methods to control the LCD interface as well as manually changing the current state of the Medical center. 
            <br><span style="font-weight:900">[Housing]</span><br>&nbsp I developed the intial housing model. I implemented "intsert" walls that would prevent water from entering the body. As the 3D printers provided were relatively small I designed the levels of the body to be stacked and screwed from the inside to create a strong structure. Features within the hosuing consist of ledges for rest the LCD screen in and particular positioning of screws for PCB and micrcontroller mounting.
            <br><span style="font-weight:900">[Interface Circuitry]</span><br>&nbsp I built and modeled a PWM output signal which was used to control an boost the output of signals from 3.3V (microcontroller output) to 5V (required output).
      </p></div>

        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">Review Process and Outcomes</h3></div>
        <div id="text"><p class="text"> 
          <span style="font-weight:900">[First Review]</span><br>&nbsp I develpoed a six-person presentation to convey the progress of each sub-team in the first two weeks of this project. We scored 8/10, which is a testament to our 
rehersals and planning that was made. We were also assessed on the Housing design where we scored 5/5.
          
<br><span style="font-weight:900">[Second Review]</span><br>&nbsp Our individual log books (Progress books) were marked for which I recieved a 7/10. I do believe this reflected the work I had, and I knew that I would need to increase in quality for a higher mark.
As a group we were graded on our power supply design (scored 5/5) and the 3D housing model (scored 5/5).
          
<br><span style="font-weight:900">[Final Review]</span><br>&nbsp In the final (seventh) week the group was assessed on our individual contribution towards the project. This mark was the largest given mark contributing to 25% of the grade. 
For this I ensured that my section of the project was completely developed with additional features and because of the +150 page report I scored full mark (25/25). I am proud of this as assessment writing is something I had struggled with on the path, however have only recently overcome it.
<br> Regarding the final group report, I co-wrote it with another team memeber. Within the report I described our final product as well as the team's achievements  of which I was proud of (as a team leader). I also answered "what if..." questions, detailing what would have gone on if we were given an
industry sized budget with an industry sized time-scheme. For this report we scored 11/15. <br> Finally we were given marks for the final product which had, rather dissapointingly, ran through issues during the final test, scoring 13/20. Though our product worked well we a lost majority of marks 
building a machine that did not comply much with the project specification. The reasoning behind this decision was made  by me.
 I wanted to create a smart-meter with aditional functionalitites as when faced with competition in a working environment products need to have unique selling points and in following with this aspect of the project takss, I wanted to create a unique device.

        <div id="sub"><h3 class="sub">Project Summary:</h3></div>
        <div id="text"><p class="text">
          In my university career this is the largest project I have been able to take part of (worth 1 Module, 7 Weeks). Knowing this I needed to make sure I had full control of my own 
mark and to do this I elected myself as the Team Leader. My final mark (79/100) was one of the highest scoring. My primary role as 'Leader' was to ensure that my team had the 
correct tools and understnading to complete the given tasks to the highest level. I used kaban-style list-making applications (Trello) as well as strong messaging-document transfer
applications (Slack) to ensure nothing was mis-communicated and within my programming team I set up a GitHub with multi-branch implementation and taught my team memebers to use it 
effectively. Personally, devdeloping my embedded C/C++ skills fruther allowed me to develop a stronger understanding of connected devices (using WAP, WIFI-module etc.), and 
implementing these skill within a simulated work environment pushed me to understand the difficulties behind designing electronic products.
<br>So far I do believe (particularly) this project is a testament of my work as a Team Leader and a programmer.
