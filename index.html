        I am currently pursuing a PhD in Intelligent Cinematography (Y2/3). My project is focused on the inverse graphics problem for dynamic scenes (i.e.) Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields. The project is supervised by <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/David-Bull-f53987d8-4d62-431b-8228-2d39f944fbfe/">Dave Bull</a>

        <h1>Online Trend Detection at Scale</h1>

          We researched and designed three innovative generalised (online) models which, given a (very) large set of univariate
          time-series data, were capable of detecting numerous types of trends. I personally implemented a trend-detection
          model which focused on re-defining the notion of a trend as 'variance-related errors with respect to the current
          state of data'. This allowed us to comprehensively evaluate both monotonic and heteroscedastic trends, which reduces the loss of
          information through model selection bias and is capable of detecting various types of behaviour (which both classical and
          SoA approaches do not).
          In addition, I contributed a (novel) optimisation technique; rather than running the same evaluation
          processes on every data point, we ran a change-point detection algorithm (initially detecting trend-incidents rather
          than entire windows) to signal 'interesting' windows of data which we then evaluated using the
          usual evaluation process. This reduced computation by >30%. Documentation can be found

        <h1>Generalised Ethical Dilemma Solver</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">MEng Thesis - Sept-May 2020/21</h2>
        <p>
          For my thesis I implemented a philosophical framework by relating classical ML techniques to philosophical
          concepts. The basis of this model was to prove that ML structures can reason (and provide reason) so long as the methods implemented
          match the dynamics of chosen philosophies. In addition, I demonstrated this application with respect to the generalised
          scope of ethical dilemmas which granted me the opportunity to test my hypothesis over various sociological and psychological
          situations where our agent would have to make a crucial decision.
          I got several professionals working in the fields of Psychology, Ethics and AI to evaluate the model and ensure
          that it does in fact reason (no technical testing methods by me would work here without compromising the
          integrity of the agent). As a result this dissertation was given the title of "award worthy" by the University of
          Southampton and suggested for publication. Source and Documentation can be found

        <h1>Solving a Maze blind using a Duelling Deep Q-Network</h1>

        <p>
          As a result of the progression made with deep Q-learning, we assess methods of optimisation which will allow our actor, who is globally-blind 
          (can only observe their direct surroundings), to solve a large maze. We have inspected the use of <i>combined experience replay</i> 
          (A Deeper Look at Experience Replay, Zhang and Sutton, 2017) for our transition buffer, as well as compared the greedy episilon and Boltzmann eplxoration 
          methods. Repository for this project can be found

        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">Literature Review and Model Extension - Jan-May 2022 - Not Published</h2>
        <p>
          I reproduced and extended the proposed <i>Genetic Algorithm</i>; which focuses on replicating the conditions of
          grouping and dispersal in bacterial micro-colonies to provide insight into the evolution of cooperation (and
          further to understand if strategies exist to ensure cooperation is selected for in evolving
          societies).
          The extension focused on better representing individuals to allow for imprecisions in their understanding of
          the simulated environment. The paper and adjoint code can be found

          A reproduction of, <i>Are Neural Nets Modular? Inspecting Functional Modularity through Differentiable Weight Masks</i>
          , R Csordas et Al., International Conference on Representation Learning, 2021.
          We reproduce the proposed tool for inspecting functional modularity and tested it on a range of NNs
          (notably CNNs and RNNs). We were ultimately able to replicate several results, though found the original implementation to be somewhat contrived.

        <h1>Spatial Distribution of Sensor Network under Star Topology</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">Research Internship at <a href="https://lurtis.com/en/">Lurtis Rules</a> - July-Nov 2020  - Rejection</h2>
        <p>
          During this internship I wrote a comparative paper (unpublished) on evaluating linear and non-linear strategies
          of node distribution for generalised irregular (agricultural) fields; supervised by
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-m-chema-pe%C3%B1a-a0944569/">Jose M. Pena</a>. We worked with strategies
          concerning <i>Differential Evolution</i> and found that linear startegies can sometimes outperform non-linear
          strategies as a result of over-complication particular when presented with a nearly-regular "iregular" field shape.
