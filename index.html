        My interests lie in Human-Centered AI - keenly influenced by my passion for Philosophy, Psychology and
        Sociology.

        I am critical of systems which do not utilise the appropriate model structures to fit their objective and wish to
        contribute towards more reasoned frameworks.

        For my MEng I studied at the <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a> and wrote my dissertation on philosophical frameworks
        by relating classification techniques such as PCA and LDA to philosophical and sociological concepts; supervised by

          , R Csordas et Al., International Conference on Representation Learning, 2021.
          We aim to reproduce the proposed tool for inspecting functional modularity and will test it on a range of NNs
          (notably CNNs and RNNs).

        <h1>The Importance of Group-Size Preferences for the Evolution of Cooperation Under the Conditions of Individual Selection</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">Literature Review and Model Extension - Jan-May 2022</h2>
        <p>
          I reproduced and extended the proposed Genetic Algorithm; which focuses on replicating the conditions of
          grouping and dispersal in bacterial micro-colonies to provide insight into the evolution of cooperation (and
          further to understand if strategies exist to ensure cooperation is selected for in evolving
          societies).
          The extension focused on better representing individuals to allow for imprecisions in their understanding of
          the simulated environment. The paper and adjoint code can be found

        <h1>Online Trend Detection at Scale</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">MEng Group Design Project - Client: Senseye Ltd. - Sept-Jan 2021/22</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:-10px">
          I retained the position of Secretary and Primary Author for this group project.

        <p>
          We researched and designed three innovative generalised (online) models which, given a (very) large set of univariate
          time-series data, were capable of detecting numerous types of trends. I personally implemented a trend-detection
          model which focused on re-defining the notion of a trend as 'variance-related errors with respect to the current
          state of data'. This allowed us to extrapolate both monotonic and heteroscedastic trends, which reduced the detection error.
          In addition, I contributed an essential (novel) optimisation technique; rather than running the same evaluation
          processes on every data point, we ran a change-point detection algorithm (inherently less erroneous than
          classical trend-detection models) to signal 'interesting' windows of data which we then evaluated using the
          usual evaluation process. This reduced computation by >30%. Documentation can be found

        <h1>Generalised Ethical Dilemma Solver</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-top:-10px">MEng Thesis - Sept-May 2020/21</h2>
        <p>
          For my thesis I implemented a philosophical framework by relating classical ML techniques to philosophical
          concepts. The basis of this model was to prove that ML structures can reason (and provide reason) so long as the methods implemented
          match the dynamics of chosen philosophies. In addition, I demonstrated this application with respect to the generalised
          scope of ethical dilemmas which granted me the opportunity to test my hypothesis over various sociological and psychological
          situation where our agent would have to make a crucial decision.
          I got several professionals working in the fields of Psychology, Ethics and AI to evaluate the model and ensure
          that it does in fact reason (no technical testing methods by me would work here without compromising the
          integrity of the agent). As a result this dissertation was given the title of "award worthy" by the University of
          Southampton and suggested for publication. Source and Documentation can be found
